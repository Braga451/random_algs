# Technically, OpenGL is merely a specification, developed and maintained by khronos.org

# The OpenGL specification specifies exactly what the result/output of each function should be and how it should perform

# Most implementations of OpenGL are built by graphics card manufactures

# OpenGL is by itself a large state machine

# An object in OpenGL is a collection of options that represents a subset of OpenGL's state

# GLFW can be used to create an OpenGL context, define a window parameters, and handle user input
